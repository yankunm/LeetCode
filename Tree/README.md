# Tree

## Introduction
 
Trees are the most fundamental data structure in Computer Science. We will study how trees are used to evaluate arithemetic expressions, support logarithmic operations in data collections, and refine search operations to logarithmic time. Binary Search Trees are the foundations of TreeSet and TreeMap structures in Java.
