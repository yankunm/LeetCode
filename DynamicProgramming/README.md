# Dynamic Programming

## Search

When a given problem is composed of multiple subproblems, we can keep on breaking down the problem and ultimately CONSTRUCT the BIGGER problem using all the SUB-PROBLEMS.

When analyzing your **search space**, always draw a **Tree**.

The time complexity of the search problenm depends on: <br>
1. The depth of the search space tree
2. The number of children of each node

**The most important part of all search problem or any dynamic programming problem, is to define your state well. Make sure every subproblem can be described as a *state*.**
