# Heap

Heap is a *Complete Binary Tree* constructed using an array. The **root** of the tree is either the maximum element (max heap) or the minimum element (min heap).

**Common APIs:**
* peek(): Return at top element in heap (O(1))
* poll(): Remove top element in heap (O(log n))
* offer(): Insert element (O(log n))

## Online Algorithm (usually Heap)

Work with streams, **no fixed size**, scalable.

## Offline Algorithm (Sorting)

Work with **fixed length** data, has to be reused after every scaling.
