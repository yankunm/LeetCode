# DFS

DFS is recursive, go as far as possible before backtracking.

## DFS Template

1. Base Case

-- Do Something()

-- Recurse for sub-problem (Believe!!)

### Top-Down Recursion

1. Pass down the result as a parameter <br>
2. Usually no return value <br>

### Bottom-Up Recursion (Harder, More Common)

1. Get the **result** from sub-problem <br>
2. Use that **result** to do work at current level to compute a *Solution* <br>
3. return the *Solution* to parent level
